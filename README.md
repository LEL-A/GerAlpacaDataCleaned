# 🇩🇪 🦙🛁 Cleaned German Alpaca Dataset

Welcome to the Cleaned German Alpaca Dataset repository! This repository hosts a cleaned, curated and translated version of the [Cleaned Alpaca Dataset](https://github.com/gururise/AlpacaDataCleaned).

# Data Curation

In the initial step, we used the Cleaned Alpaca Dataset and translated it into German via the [`facebook/wmt19-en-de`] model from the Hugging Face Model Hub.

The Notebook `Translate-Cleaned-Alpaca-Dataset.ipynb` shows all necessary steps. The resulting dataset, [`translated_german_alpaca.json`](translated_german_alpaca.json)
serves as a good start for further improvements!

# Goals

The primary goal of this project is to provide a cleaned and curated version of a German Alpaca dataset that will improve the performance of NLP models trained on this data.
By removing errors and inconsistencies, the goal is to improve performance of the fine-tuned models.

# Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the authors of the Cleaned Alpaca dataset for their effort.

We would like to thank the original creators of the Alpaca datasets for making their data available to the public.
